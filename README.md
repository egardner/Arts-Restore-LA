Wordpress theme for artsrestore.la site


This is a responsive wordpress theme built created for the Arts Restore LA: Westwood event organized by the Hammer Museum during the fall of 2013. It is very much still a work in progress, and is published here for backup/archival purposes.

This theme is a child theme of Drew Morris' Wordpress port of Foundation 4 (https://github.com/drewsymo/Foundation), so that theme must be installed for this one to function.

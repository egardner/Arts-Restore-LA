Arts-Restore-LA
===============

Wordpress theme for http://artsrestore.la


This is a responsive wordpress theme built created for the Arts Restore LA: Westwood event organized by the Hammer Museum during the fall of 2013. It is very much still a work in progress, and is published here for backup/archival purposes.

This theme is a child theme of Drew Morris' Wordpress port of Foundation 4 (https://github.com/drewsymo/Foundation), so that theme must be installed for this one to function.

Other dependencies include Typekit (for Futura PT fonts in style.css) and the "Add Custom Post Types to Nav Menu" WP plugin (http://wordpress.org/plugins/add-custom-post-types-archive-to-nav-menus/).

Designed and developed by Eric Gardner, Graphic Designer, Hammer Museum.
